"""Call the read structure from a positional profile.

Reading the profile
-------------------
`p5_match[p]` is the fraction of reads whose base p matches the genome base the
alignment implies for it. Because a soft-clipped base still has an implied
coordinate, this is close to

    P(p is inside the aligned block) + P(p is clipped) * 1/4

i.e. essentially the CDF of the 5'-clip length, lifted by a 1/4 chance-match
floor. Three consequences drive the rules below:

* A 5' UMI of length u forces a clip of >= u in nearly every read, so
  `p5_match[p] ~ 0.25` for p < u and jumps to ~0.95 at p = u. A **step**.
* Low-quality or mis-mapped reads produce a long tail of large clips, which
  lifts `p5_match` **smoothly** across many positions. Not a step. Calling a
  UMI on the level alone would mistake that tail for architecture, so the RT
  test below looks at the increment, not the level.
* A non-templated base added by the reverse transcriptase is present in only a
  fraction f of molecules, so it depresses exactly one position by
  f * (plateau - 0.25) and creates a single sharp increment.

On the 3' side the footprint length varies read to read, so read position is
meaningless. The alignment end is also useless as an anchor: local alignment
stops at a mismatch, so the base just past it disagrees with the genome *by
construction* (match rate 0.00). The two honest anchors are the adapter start
and the read's own 3' end.

Segment vocabulary, insert-first:
    [5' UMI][RT nt][=== footprint ===][3' UMI][barcode][adapter]
Any of them may be absent, and the 3' UMI and barcode can swap places.

`infer()` never guesses: when the profile carries no readable boundary it
returns `status='undetermined'` with a human-readable reason (see §9 of
docs/METHOD.md). That refusal is an answer, not an error.
